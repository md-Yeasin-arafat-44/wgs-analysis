# wgs-analysis
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of scripts for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. It covers essential steps in bioinformatics pipelines for processing microbial or eukaryotic genomes, including quality assessment, assembly, taxonomic classification, annotation, pan-genome construction, and visualization. The scripts are primarily written in Python, Bash, or R, and leverage popular bioinformatics tools to streamline WGS workflows.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ (with libraries like Biopython, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Bash shell (for script execution)
Bioinformatics tools: FastQC, Trimmomatic, SPAdes, Prokka, Roary/PIRATE, etc. (install via conda or package managers)
Optional: Conda environment for dependency management
Access to high-performance computing if dealing with large datasets
